# Other Sirius Information

Other information about Sirius.

## DomainX Premium

DomainX was discontinued so the team could focus more on Sirius, along with this, DomainX became open source, making premium useless. DomainX premium users are able to transfer their licenses to Sirius Pro if they haven't already. They will just need some type of proof of purchase.

## Solaris Premium

Most of the Sirius team were either owners or developers for a script called Solaris which was discontinued in August of 2022. For 2 weeks, Solaris Premium users were able to get free Sirius Essential. However, this deal is no longer a thing.

## Keys?

Sirius is unable to provide keys for other scripts. You were most likely invited by a script which uses [Rayfield](https://rayfield.dev) (our UI library) and the developer probably didn't change the invite URL to their own. If you're looking for a Sirius key, you can purchase [here](https://buy.sirius.menu).
